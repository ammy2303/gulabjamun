                    History Of Gulab Jamun
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Gulab Jamun is believed to be originated in India, somewhere around the medieval period but you will be shocked to know that your favourite sweet dish hails from Persia. This delicacy is very much similar to an Arabic dessert named 'Luqmat-Al-Qadi', which was introduced to India with the invasion of Mughal emperors. A theory also suggests that it was first prepared by the personal Persian chef of Shah Jahan but there is no evidence to support this theory.
                </p>
                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p id="ingredients">
                    Have you ever wondered where this beautiful name ‘Gulab Jamun’ came from for this delectable sweet dish? The world ‘Gulab’ was derived from the Persian word ‘gol’ and ‘ab’ which respectively meant flower and water which referred to rose water scented syrup. The other word 'Jamun' is the Hindi-Urdu word for the popular Indian fruit Black Plum which is almost of same shape and size. So, this is how your loving dessert got its name.
